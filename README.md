### Editing SASS
Preprocessing - Editing SASS
"The most direct way to make this happen is in your terminal. Once Sass is installed, you can compile your Sass to CSS using the sass command." - Sass-lang

`sass input.scss output.css`

`sass scss/styles.sass css/styles.css`

The watch flag tells Sass to watch your source files for changes, and re-compile CSS each time you save your Sass.

`sass --watch scss/styles.sass css/styles.css`

You can watch and output to directories by using folder paths as your input and output, and separating them with a colon.

`sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets`

`sass --watch scss/styles.sass:css/styles.css`
