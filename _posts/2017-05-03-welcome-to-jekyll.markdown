This blog is the first project I've made utilizing Jekyll. It was an interesting endeavor and proud creation. I have to admit getting the project started was frustrating. After clearing my first blockade, building became simple and customization a fun exploration.

On Monday, April 24 Frontend Orlando hosted a meetup titled "<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Front-End-Orlando/events/238771715/">Static Site Generators with Brian Rinaldi</a>". During this event Brian demoed and broke down Jekyll. Beginning with the commands to start a build. Later he showed examples of sites made with Jekyll.

Why Static? The reasons he gave was that it was fast, secure and flexible. With no server side, database to deal with thus no holes Jekyll makes for a secure option. Plus I'm sure there are a lot of people who dislike dealing with databases. Since Jekyll can do whatever it is you want, your limitation is up to your imagination. Okay, skill set as well, having a background in web design did help me. Though mastering Google search and reading documentations is helpful enough.

I've been in need of a blog for my own <a href="http://katherinedelorme.com/">portfolio site</a> but WordPress seemed like a heavy option for such a small desire. Jekyll was a solution that focuses more on content. No databases, comment moderation or annoying updates. Not to mention debugging when an issue arises from an update.

Tedious? Frustrating? Well that's a question you'll have to answer for yourself. To each there own and for some this may work and others not so much.

What Jekyll does is take templating languages (.md, .yml, .scss, .coffee, etc.) runs it through an engine and spits out html, css and js. Making it a bit easier to build and maintain a site. What tool is Jekyll built on? Ruby. But you don't need an in-depth knowledge of Ruby in order to get started.

So what do you think of my first Jekyll build? <a href="http://katherinedelorme.com/contact">Reach out and let me know</a>.
